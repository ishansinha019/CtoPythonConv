# C-to-Python-convertor
This program is written in C language. This can be used for converting an existing C code into Python code based on the available options that are provided in both the mentioned languages. It aims to provide fast and accurate method of converting code on the basis of syntax, thus providing no or less manual conversion by us. It does well with variable declaration, for, while loops, if else, input, output processes, other keywords available in both the languages and provides proper indentation of the Python code. The project has certain limitations that it doesnâ€™t include classes, functions, or complicated data structures but this could be improved or added later as an extension to the project.
